			<h2>Welcome to my Website!</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Will Xia, and this is my personal website! 
            I'm a Computer Science undergrad based in the Boston area.
            On this website, you can find more information about me, my work, and my interests. 
            Feel free to explore and get in touch if you have any questions.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm currently enrolled in the Tufts School of Engineering as a Computer Science major 
            and Entrepreneurship Minor. My graduation year is 2025. I have not decided on a particular concentration 
            within CS, but I am currently interested in networking and web design. I'm pursuing Entrepreneurship 
            to understand what goes into making a successful company.  I believe that the financial skills I learn 
            from Entrepreneurship will be very helpful in my career and life, even if no opportunity arises to 
            start my business.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy going to the <a href="3day_routine.png" target="_blank">gym</a>.
            I also like playing games. The games I enjoy the most right now are 
            <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/slappkake?" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> and Magic the Gathering.</p>

            <p>I also enjoy taking photos, I'm currently enrolled in a Digital Photography course. You can find a collection of my personal scanned 
            polaroids <a href="https://vsco.co/willl-xia/gallery" target="_blank">here</a> and a collection of my digital photography course projects 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nlQw72yY938lPK_HkgN2PXFjRzpZSJvK?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
